Welcome to Coffee Ghar, your neighborhood coffee spot located in the heart of Kathmandu, Nepal. At Coffee Ghar, we believe coffee is more than just a beverage—it’s an experience, a moment of peace, and a way to connect with the people around us.

Our Story
Coffee Ghar began as a small family-run café with one simple mission: to share the love of quality, ethically-sourced coffee with our local community.

Our founder’s passion for both travel and coffee led to a journey across South Asia and South America, building relationships with small farms and cooperatives. Every cup we serve reflects this journey—from the farmers who grow our beans to our in-house roasting process that brings out each origin’s distinct flavor.

Delivery & Locations Served
Along with providing a warm, welcoming space in our café, we also offer delivery across Kathmandu. Whether you’re at home, in the office, or enjoying a stroll at Garden of Dreams or Patan Durbar Square, we bring your favorite coffee straight to you. With just a few taps, your daily brew is on its way.

Our Menu
At Coffee Ghar, there’s something for everyone. From our rich espresso blends and refreshing cold brews to soothing teas and fresh-baked goods from local Nepali bakeries, we have it all. We also cater to different lifestyles, offering plant-based milk options and gluten-free treats.

Community & Sustainability
We’re proud to be a part of Kathmandu’s vibrant community and are committed to sustainability. We use eco-friendly packaging, support local farmers and artisans, and continually look for ways to reduce our environmental impact. From hosting live acoustic evenings to art pop-ups and book clubs, Coffee Ghar is more than a café—it’s a community space.
