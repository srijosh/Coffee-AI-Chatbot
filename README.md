# Coffee Ghar â˜• â€“ AI Chatbot with Product Recommendation, RAG, and e-Commerce Integration

Coffee Ghar is an AI-powered customer service and recommendation chatbot built for a coffee shop. It combines an agent-based architecture, LLaMA 3.3â€“70B, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Apriori-based product recommendations to enable seamless ordering, information retrieval, and real-time assistance via a frontend e-commerce interface.

## Introduction

This project features an intelligent coffee shop chatbot system that understands user intents (like greetings, product orders, or information queries), recommends complementary items using market basket analysis, and fetches factual answers using RAG with LLaMA 3.3â€“70B. It supports both backend FastAPI endpoints and a React + TypeScript-based frontend that includes user login, order history, and eSewa sandbox payment.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Coffee Shop Sample Dataset â€“ Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ylchang/coffee-shop-sample-data-1113)
- **Files Used:**: Saved as `news_articles_dataset.csv` with columns:
  - `201904 sales receipts.csv`: Contains transactional data.
  - `product.csv`: Contains product names and categories.
- **Use**: Used for mining frequent itemsets and generating product recommendations via Apriori and association rule mining.

## Features

- Modular agent-based architecture:

- Guard Agent: Filters irrelevant queries.

- Classification Agent: Routes intent to appropriate handlers.

- Order Taking Agent: Extracts items and quantities from orders.

- Recommendation Agent: Suggests frequently bought-together items using Apriori.

- Details Agent (RAG): Answers FAQs using vector search (MiniLM) + LLaMA 3.3â€“70B.

- Custom Apriori and association rule mining implementation.

- React-based e-commerce frontend with cart and live chat.

- Login system and order history tracking.

- eSewa sandbox integration for payments.
